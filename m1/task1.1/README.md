#DevOps. My view.
## This specialization is all abount permanent challenges and self-developing.
## Yoh have to combine the knowledge of underlying infrastructure, code, testing, deploying and an endless row of automatisation and deployment tools.
## However, this challenge is amazing and makes this IT role absorbing and captivating.
## But the most fascinating thing about DevOps is that everything is moving to the Cloud which evolves and in this way facilitates and speeds up your performance.

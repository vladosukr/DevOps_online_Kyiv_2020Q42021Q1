#DevOps. My view.
## This specialization is all abount permanent challenges and self-developing.
## Yoh have to combine the knowledge of underlying infrastructure, code, testing, deploying and an endless row of automatisation and deployment tools.
## However, this challenge is amazing and makes this IT role absorbing and captivating.
